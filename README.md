# Overtime app (comming Soon)

Rails app track if salaried employees did or did not get overtime each week.

As part of FSL, I have to complete a Rails training project, following a course from Udemy. This time the course [Professional Rails Code Along][udemy-course] is my target. Let's go for it!

This project should be a "real world Rails project using TDD/BDD", with professional features like:

- Using TDD and BDD with the RSpec and Capybara testing frameworks
- Working with the Twilio API to send SMS messages
- Integrating a permission structure for users
- Implementing an administrator dashboard
- Working with automated email components
- Creating an approval workflow from scratch
- Creating JavaScript Growl notifications
- And much more!

I will try to also infuse modern features and update the code as uch as possible.

## Desired State

At the end (when `dev` branch merges to `master`), we expect to have all the aforementioned features and to follow the original's designs:

![app-preview-2](docs/app-preview-2.png)
![app-preview-3](docs/app-preview-3.png)
![app-preview-4](docs/app-preview-4.png)
![app-preview-5](docs/app-preview-5.png)
![app-preview-6](docs/app-preview-6.png)
![app-preview-7](docs/app-preview-7.png)
![app-preview-8](docs/app-preview-8.png)

I'll try to commit as much as possible, and to follow `gitflow`, so please check commits and branches.

> In branch dev you can find my latest code on this project!
